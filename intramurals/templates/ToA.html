We are unable to accept credit cards issued by banks outside of the United States or prepaid gift cards issued by credit card companies. Debit cards and check cards have daily spending limits that may prevent the processing of your order.

If a transaction has been declined online due to credit card issues, or issues with your PayPal account, please ensure all data is correct and resubmit. If the transaction is not accepted online, you will be unable to use that card or your PayPal account (as the case may be) for your transaction and should use another credit card.

BILLING

If you are transacting using 1-Click or your PayPal account, your order may be authorized and billed in gradual increments during one purchasing and renting (as applicable) session as you click the "Buy Now" button. Depending on the size of your order, this may appear as multiple orders and billings on your credit card statement.

If you use the Shopping Cart functionality, you will have one order that authorizes and bills as a single transaction.

SALES TAX

iTunes Store transactions will include sales tax based on the bill-to address and the sales tax rate in effect at the time your transaction is completed. If the sales tax rate for the billing address changes before the purchased or rented (as applicable) digital content is downloaded, the new tax rate in effect at the time of download will apply. We will only charge tax in states where digital goods are taxable. No customers are eligible for tax exemptions for transactions made on the iTunes Store.

PRE-ORDERS

By pre-ordering Products, you are authorizing the iTunes Store to automatically charge your account and download the product when it becomes available. You may cancel your pre-order prior to the time the item becomes available, by going to your Account page and clicking Manage Pre-Orders on your computer, or in the downloads section on your iPod touch or iPhone. Pre-orders purchased from your computer can only be managed and downloaded on your computer.

GIFT CERTIFICATE TRANSACTIONS

Gift Certificates may be redeemed for iTunes Store transactions only and are non-refundable, except as required by law. They cannot be used for purchases on the Apple Online Store or used in Apple Retail Stores. Sales tax will not be charged when the Gift Certificate is purchased. Sales tax is charged when the Gift Certificate is used for an iTunes Store transaction. The tax rate on the transaction is based on the address of the redeemer (see Tax section for more information). Purchases for Gift Certificates may be purchased only in whole dollar increments or designated amounts. Gift Certificates may not be used to purchase other Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards or Allowance Accounts.

ALLOWANCE ACCOUNTS

Allowance Accounts are for transactions on the iTunes Store only. The Allowance Account may not be used for gifts, or purchases on the Apple Online Store or in Apple Retail Stores. Sales tax will be charged when the Allowance Account is used to make an iTunes Store transaction. The tax rate on the transaction is based on the address of the account user (see Sales Tax section for more information). Allowance Account balances are non-refundable. Allowance Account balances may not be used to purchase Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards or other Allowance Accounts.

iTUNES CARDS

iTunes Cards are for transactions on the iTunes Store only. iTunes Cards may not be used for gifts, or purchases on the Apple Online Store or in Apple Retail Stores. iTunes Cards are non-refundable, except as required by law. iTunes Cards may not be used to purchase Gift Certificates, Allowance Accounts or other iTunes Cards.

GIFTS

Gifts purchased from the iTunes Store in the United States may be purchased only for, and redeemed only by, residents of the United States. Gifts are non-refundable. Gifts may not be purchased with iTunes Cards, Gift Certificates or Allowance Accounts. Gifts may not be used for Movie Rentals or Apps.

COMPLETE MY ALBUM ("CMA")

If you have acquired select songs or music videos from the iTunes Store, Apple may offer you the ability to "complete" the corresponding album (if any) by purchasing the remaining songs or music videos of the album at a price that is less than the full album price. Please note that for some albums (where the full album price equals the sum of the single prices of all its songs), completing the album using CMA does not reduce your price for the remaining songs or music videos compared to buying them individually. CMA may not be available for all songs or music videos you have acquired or will acquire from the iTunes Store, and availability of particular CMA offers is subject to change without notice. Albums that are no longer available for sale on the iTunes Store, partial albums and certain other albums are not eligible for CMA. Songs or music videos acquired through free promotions are not eligible for CMA, except in the case of certain select free content code promotions. CMA is not available for any content acquired from the iTunes Store other than songs and music videos. Except in the case of special promotions that Apple may conduct at its discretion, in some circumstances, you will have no more than 180 days from the time you acquire your first CMA-eligible song or video off a particular CMA-eligible album to accept that CMA offer. CMA is only available on your computer.

For more information about CMA, please read the FAQ at http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305232.

ITUNES PLUS

Select songs or music videos may be available on the iTunes Store in the iTunes Plus format. iTunes Plus content does not contain security technology that restricts your usage of such content, and is encoded at a higher audio bit rate than the DRM-protected songs or music videos available on the iTunes Store. iTunes Plus content also is subject to fewer Usage Rules; please see the iTunes Store Terms of Service for details.

You may upgrade songs and music videos you previously have purchased from the iTunes Store that are eligible for upgrade using your computer. Songs or music videos may be eligible for upgrade only if the same song or music video is available for sale on the iTunes Store in the iTunes Plus format at the time of the upgrade. The eligibility of particular songs and music videos for upgrade to iTunes Plus and your total upgrade offer are subject to change at any time. Before you upgrade, you will be shown the total price for the upgrade, and will have an opportunity to review the specific content that will be upgraded. The upgraded iTunes Plus versions of your content will replace the DRM-protected versions in your iTunes library, and the DRM-protected files will be moved to your Trash or Recycling Bin folder. For more information on how the upgrade price is calculated and details about the replacement of the DRM-protected versions, please review the FAQ (see below).

CMA may be available for iTunes Plus content, subject to the CMA terms and conditions set forth above. Upgrading prior purchases to iTunes Plus does not affect the time limits applicable to CMA availability.

For more information about iTunes Plus, please read the FAQ at http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/iTunesPlusFAQPage.

RING TONES

Ring tone Products available for purchase on the iTunes Store are usable only on iPhones, and may be purchased only through the iTunes Store available on iPhones (not using computers). In addition, using the iTunes application and subject to a separate fee, you may be able to create ring tone Products, usable only on iPhones and no more than 30 seconds in length, from eligible songs that you have purchased from the iTunes Store and which reside in your iTunes Library. Eligibility for ring tone creation and purchase is determined at the time you choose to purchase the ring tone you have created, not at the time you originally purchase the song from the iTunes Store. The eligibility of particular songs for ring tone creation and purchase is subject to change at any time. Indications of ring tone eligibility for particular songs in your iTunes application are provided solely for convenience, and do not guarantee that the applicable song will be eligible for ring tone creation and purchase at any time in the future. Ring tone Products are subject to specific Usage Rules; please see the iTunes Store Terms of Service for details.

SEASON PASS, MULTI-PASS

Season Pass includes all currently available (if any) and future episodes of the purchased program season, as may be indicated on the iTunes Store for the particular Season Pass. Multi-Pass includes the episodes of the purchased program specified on the purchase page. The full price of the Season Pass or Multi-Pass is charged upon purchase. No refunds, returns or cancellations after purchase. In the event that a network or studio delivers fewer episodes than planned at the time of your Season Pass purchase (and as may have been indicated on the iTunes Store for the particular Season Pass), we will credit to your Account the retail value of the corresponding number of TV episodes. For example, if a Season Pass has 22 planned episodes at the time of your purchase, but the network or studio only delivers 20 episodes, we will credit to your Account an amount equal to the retail price of two TV episodes. Currently available purchased episodes (if any) download upon purchase of the Season Pass or Multi-Pass. Future purchased episodes become available for download as they appear on iTunes, and may then be downloaded by the purchaser by connecting to the iTunes Store on your computer and selecting Check for Available Downloads in the Store menu in iTunes 8 and 9 (or Check for Purchases in the Store menu in iTunes 7). Purchaser must connect to iTunes and download any remaining episodes in the Season Pass or Multi-Pass within 90 days after the final purchased episode becomes available on iTunes (or such other time period as may be specified on the purchase page), after which such remaining episodes may no longer be available for download as part of the Season Pass or Multi-Pass purchase. Automatic renewal is available for Multi-Pass purchases. If automatic renewal is selected when you purchase a Multi-Pass, you will be charged the full price of each subsequent Multi-Pass cycle and the corresponding episodes will become available to you as set forth above, unless and until you cancel automatic renewal prior to the beginning of any such subsequent Multi-Pass cycle. Automatic renewal of Multi-Pass purchases may be disabled prior to purchase of the current Multi-Pass cycle by unchecking the "Automatically renew this Multi-Pass" check box in the purchase dialog box on your computer. In addition, Season Pass and Multi-Pass purchases may be reviewed, and automatic renewal may be selected or canceled for any current or future Multi-Pass that you have purchased, in the Manage Passes section of your Account, on your computer. Once a subsequent Multi-Pass cycle has been purchased pursuant to an automatic renewal, it may no longer be cancelled and there are no refunds or returns. Season Passes and Multi Passes cannot be purchased or managed from your iPod touch or iPhone.

Please also see Upgrades below.

iTUNES PASS

iTunes Pass provides purchasers with a select variety of content (which may comprise songs, albums, music videos, and editorial content) made available by a particular artist, group, or group of artists during a pre-determined, set time period (the "Pass Period"). The full price of the iTunes Pass is charged at the time of purchase. The purchase price of the iTunes Pass will not exceed the fair market value of the individual items offered as part of the iTunes Pass. No refunds, returns or cancellations. Currently available content (if any) will download upon purchase of the iTunes Pass. Future iTunes Pass content becomes available for download as it is made available on iTunes. To download, connect to iTunes and select Check for Available Downloads in the Store menu in iTunes 8 and 9 (or Check for Purchases in the Store menu in iTunes 7) on your computer. Any new content available as a part of a purchased iTunes Pass will then download. Purchaser must connect to iTunes on their computer and download any remaining iTunes Pass content within 90 days after the end of the Pass Period (or such other time period as may be specified on the purchase page), after which such remaining content may no longer be available for download as part of the iTunes Pass purchase. iTunes Passes cannot be purchased or managed from your iPod touch or iPhone.

iTUNES LP AND iTunes Extras

iTunes LP and iTunes Extras Products are usable only on computers with iTunes 9 or higher.

If you purchase a Product (e.g., a music album) that includes an iTunes LP using an iPhone or iPod touch, the iTunes LP will not download to your iPhone or iPod touch and instead will be added to your download queue, and you may add it to the iTunes library on your Apple-authorized computer by selecting Check for Available Downloads in the Store menu in iTunes 9. In order to enjoy all the features of the iTunes LP, you also will need to sync the purchased content that was downloaded to your iPhone or iPod touch to the same Apple-authorized computer to which the iTunes LP was downloaded. If your computer does not yet have iTunes 9, you will need to install iTunes 9 in order to download and use the iTunes LP purchased on your iPhone or iPod touch. Please see Upgrades below.

iPOD GAMES

iPod Games currently available on the iTunes Store are compatible only with iPod classic, 3rd generation and 4th generation iPod nanos, and 5th generation (video) iPods. The Games will not function on any other device, including your personal computer. Updates to your existing compatible iPod's firmware may render your purchased version of a Game incompatible with that iPod. Games purchased from the iTunes Store may not be compatible with future generations of the iPod, and Apple makes no guarantee of such forward compatibility.

SOFTWARE

Software Products purchased from the iTunes Store are subject to purchaser's prior acceptance of the terms of any end-user agreements or other terms and conditions required for use of such Products.

UPGRADES

The latest version of the iTunes software is recommended to access the iTunes Store. From time to time, an upgrade to the latest version of the iTunes software may be required in order to make transactions from the iTunes Store, to download Products previously purchased from the iTunes Store (for example, Products in your download queue or future Season Pass/Multi-Pass episodes) or to take advantage of new features of the iTunes Store. The latest version of the iTunes software is available for download at no charge, and the minimum system requirements for running it are provided, at http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/. Use of iTunes software is subject to acceptance of its software license agreement presented at the time of installation. For any additional questions regarding required upgrades, please contact iTunes Store Customer Service (see below).

Apple reserves the right to enhance Products purchased or rented (as applicable) from the iTunes Store, including Products purchased but not yet downloaded. Among other things, such enhancements may result in larger file sizes (requiring, for example, longer download times and additional disk space for storage).

MOVIE RENTALS

Movies are viewable only on your Mac or Windows computer (using iTunes version 7.6 or later), iPhone, iPod touch, iPod nano (3rd or 4th generation), iPod classic, or on TVs using your Apple TV. Movies in high definition resolution (HD) are viewable only on your Mac or Windows computer or TVs using your Apple TV. Movies are viewable only on one device at a time.

You must be connected to the iTunes Store when moving or streaming movies. Once a movie is moved, it is no longer viewable on the sending device. You may only move movies to another device from your Mac or Windows computer. Movies downloaded directly to your Apple TV may not be moved.

You may view the movie an unlimited number of times during the Viewing Period. Movies are not viewable after the thirty (30) day period. Stopping, pausing or restarting a movie does not extend the available time for viewing.

The iTunes Store endeavors to offer you competitive prices on current selections. Your total price will include the price of the Product plus any applicable sales tax (in effect on the day of download). Apple reserves the right to change prices for Products offered at the iTunes Store at any time, and does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering.

CONTENT AVAILABILITY

TERMS OF SERVICE

THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND APPLE INC. ("APPLE") STATING THE TERMS THAT GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE ITUNES STORE SERVICE. THIS AGREEMENT - TOGETHER WITH ALL UPDATES, ADDITIONAL TERMS, SOFTWARE LICENSES, AND ALL OF APPLE'S RULES AND POLICIES - COLLECTIVELY CONSTITUTE THE "AGREEMENT" BETWEEN YOU AND APPLE. TO AGREE TO THESE TERMS, CLICK "AGREE." IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT CLICK "AGREE," AND DO NOT USE THE SERVICE. YOU MUST ACCEPT AND ABIDE BY THESE TERMS AS PRESENTED TO YOU: CHANGES, ADDITIONS, OR DELETIONS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE, AND APPLE MAY REFUSE ACCESS TO THE ITUNES STORE FOR NONCOMPLIANCE WITH ANY PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. Definition of the iTunes Store Service. Apple is the provider of the iTunes Store (the "Service") that permits you to purchase or rent (as applicable) digital content, such as sound recordings and videos (including movies and television shows), games, software, and ring tones, under certain terms and conditions as set forth in this Agreement.

2. Age requirements for use of the Service. This Service is available for individuals aged 13 years or older. If you are 13 or older but under the age of 18, you should review these terms and conditions with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand these terms and conditions.

3. Objectionable Material. You understand that by using the Service, you may encounter content that may be deemed offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit language. Nevertheless, you agree to use the Service at your sole risk and that Apple shall have no liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Content types (including genres, sub-genres and Podcast categories and sub-categories and the like) and descriptions are provided for convenience, and you acknowledge and agree that Apple does not guarantee their accuracy.

4. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION. (1) To avoid muscle, joint or eye strain during video game play, you should always take frequent breaks from playing, and stop and take a longer rest if your eyes, hands, wrists, or arms become tired or sore or you feel any other discomfort. (2) A very small percentage of people may experience seizures or blackouts when exposed to flashing lights or patterns, including while playing video games or watching videos. Symptoms may include dizziness, nausea, involuntary movements, loss of awareness, altered vision, tingling, numbness, or other discomforts. Consult a doctor before playing video games if you have ever suffered these or other symptoms linked to seizures and/or epilepsy, and stop playing immediately and see a doctor if these or similar symptoms occur during game play. Parents should monitor their children’s video game play for signs of symptoms.

5. System Requirements. Use of the Service requires one or more compatible devices, Internet access (fees may apply), and certain software (fees may apply), and may require obtaining updates or upgrades from time to time. Because use of the Service involves hardware, software, and Internet access, your ability to use the Service may be affected by the performance of these factors. High speed Internet access is strongly recommended (and is required for Movie Rentals). You acknowledge and agree that such system requirements, which may be changed from time to time, are your responsibility. The Service is not part of any other product or offering, and no purchase or rental (as applicable) or obtaining of any other product shall be construed to represent or guarantee you access to the Service.

6. Policies and Rules. Your use of the Service and transactions made through it are subject to Apple's Terms of Sale at http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html#SALE, which can be readily viewed on the Service, and any end-user agreements or other terms and conditions required for use of the Service, all of which are hereby made a part of this Agreement.

If you would prefer we not collect and use information from your iTunes library in this manner, you should not enable the Genius feature. You can revoke your opt-in choice at any time by choosing to turn off the Genius feature from the Store menu on your computer. Upon opting-out, iTunes will no longer send information about your iTunes library to Apple. If you have elected to share your library from multiple computers, you need to turn off the Genius feature from each computer. The Genius feature cannot be enabled or disabled from your iPod touch or iPhone.

By opting-in to the Genius feature, you consent to the use of your information as described above and as described in the Apple Customer Privacy Policy.

c. Genius for Apps. When you opt-in to the Genius for Apps feature, Apple will, from time to time, automatically collect information related to the applications on your device, such as your time spent with each application and the number of times each application is launched. This information will be stored anonymously and not associated with your name or iTunes account. When you use the Genius for Apps feature, Apple will use this information, as well as other information, such as your application download history, to give personalized recommendations to you.

Apple may use this information and combine it with aggregated information from other users who opt-in to this feature, your iTunes Store purchase history data, your App Store download data, aggregated application download data from other users, and other information like customer ratings of applications, to:

• Provide you with App recommendations regarding applications, media, and other products and services that you may wish to purchase, download, or use.

b. Use of Products. You acknowledge that Products (other than the iTunes Plus Products) contain security technology that limits your usage of Products to the following applicable Usage Rules, and, whether or not Products are limited by security technology, you agree to use Products in compliance with the applicable Usage Rules.

(x) You agree that you will not attempt to, or encourage or assist any other person to, circumvent or modify any security technology or software that is part of the Service or used to administer the Usage Rules.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND APPLE INC. ("APPLE") STATING THE TERMS THAT GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE APP STORE SERVICE. THIS AGREEMENT - TOGETHER WITH ALL UPDATES, ADDITIONAL TERMS, SOFTWARE LICENSES, AND ALL OF APPLE'S RULES AND POLICIES - COLLECTIVELY CONSTITUTE THE "AGREEMENT" BETWEEN YOU AND APPLE. TO AGREE TO THESE TERMS, CLICK "AGREE." IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT CLICK "AGREE," AND DO NOT USE THE SERVICE. YOU MUST ACCEPT AND ABIDE BY THESE TERMS AS PRESENTED TO YOU: CHANGES, ADDITIONS, OR DELETIONS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE, AND APPLE MAY REFUSE ACCESS TO THE APP STORE FOR NONCOMPLIANCE WITH ANY PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITION OF THE APP STORE SERVICE. Apple is the provider of the App Store (the "Service") that permits you to license software products, such as games and applications, under certain terms and conditions as set forth in this Agreement.

2. AGE REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF THE SERVICE. This Service is available for individuals aged 13 years or older. If you are 13 or older but under the age of 18, you should review these terms and conditions with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand these terms and conditions.

3. U.S. ONLY. The Service is available to you only in the United States, its territories, and possessions, and is not available in any other location. You agree not to use or attempt to use the Service from outside of the available territory. Apple may use technologies to verify such compliance.

4. LICENSE OF PRODUCTS. The software products made available through the Service (the “Products”) are licensed, not sold, to you. There are two (2) categories of Products offered through the Service, as follows: (i) those Products that have been developed, and are licensed to you, by Apple (the “Apple Products”); and (ii) those Products that have been developed, and are licensed to you, by a third party developer (the “Third Party Products”). The category of any particular Product (i.e., Apple Product or Third Party Product, as the case may be) is identified on the Service application.

Your license to each Product that you obtain through the Service is subject to the Licensed Application End User License Agreement set forth below, and you agree that the terms of the Licensed Application End User License Agreement will apply to each Apple Product and to each Third Party Product that you license through the Service, unless the Product is covered by a valid end user license agreement entered into between you and the licensor of the Product (the “Licensor”), in which case the Licensor’s end user license agreement will apply to that Product. The Licensor reserves all rights in and to the Product not expressly granted to you.

You acknowledge that the license you purchase to each Apple Product that you obtain through the Service is a binding agreement between you and Apple, and that the license you purchase to each Third Party Product is a binding agreement between you and the third party licensor of that Third Party Product (“the Application Provider”) only. The Application Provider of each Third Party Product is solely responsible for that Third Party Product, the content therein, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been disclaimed, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Third Party Product or your use of that Third Party Product. You acknowledge that you are purchasing the license to each Third Party Product from the Application Provider of that Third Party Product; Apple is acting as agent for the Application Provider in providing each such Third Party Product to you; Apple is not a party to the license between you and the Application Provider with respect to that Third Party Product; and Apple is not responsible for that Third Party Product, the content therein, or any warranties or claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Third Party Product or your use of that Third Party Product.

You acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of the Licensed Application End User License Agreement, or the Application Provider’s end user license agreement, as the case may be, for each Third Party Product, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the license to any such Third Party Product, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce such license against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.

All Products made available through the Service are licensed to end user customers only.

Certain Products may include functionality that enables you to purchase additional services, or licenses to additional functionality or content for use within the Product ("In App Purchases"). In App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the Product (e.g., virtual ammunition) cannot be transferred among devices; can only be downloaded once; and after being downloaded, they cannot be replaced. Once a consumable In App Purchase is purchased and received by you, Apple shall be without liability to you in the event of any loss, destruction, or damage. All In App Purchases are deemed Products, and In App Purchases made within Third Party Products are deemed Third Party Products, and treated as such, for purposes of these terms and conditions.

5. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS. Your use of the Service and transactions made through it are subject to any end-user agreements or other terms and conditions required for use of the software required for use of the Service, all of which are hereby made a part of this Agreement.

Use of the Service requires one or more compatible devices, Internet access (fees may apply), and certain software (fees may apply), and may require obtaining updates or upgrades from time to time. Because use of the Service involves hardware, software, and Internet access, your ability to use the Service may be affected by the performance of these factors. High speed Internet access is strongly recommended. You acknowledge and agree that such system requirements, which may be changed from time to time, are your responsibility.
